    <section id="main-content" class="main-content">
        <p>I was born and raised in San Diego, California. However, my parents were born and raised in Saigon (or now called Ho Chi Minh City), Vietnam but are Chinese ethnically. Therefore, I was raised in both a Chinese and Vietnamese culture environment. I have one older brother. He is eight years older than me. I also have one dog who is very energetic as she is mixed with various large, active dog breeds. Her name is Latte.</p>
        <p>I am a third year student at San Diego State University. I am currently majoring in Art with emphasis in Multimedia. I chose this major because it seemed versatile and allows me to explore various mediums or medias. I am also minoring in Marketing. I hope to work in either the graphic design or digital marketing fields.</p>
        <p>During my spare time, I like to make digital art, such as digital collages. I also like to bake and cook, such as banana bread and pumpkin bread. I simply like to just chill and spend time with my friends and family as I am a person who values quality time very much.</p>
