<h2> About Me</h2>
</div>

<div class="main-content">
<p>I am 26 years old, and am in my final year of San Diego State University before graduating in the winter. I am majoring in Multimedia with a Minor in American Indian Studies, which was a requirement for me to enroll in financial aid for some reason. </p>
<p>I aim to enter the animation industry where I can pitch and direct my own shows. I feel that this is a career path for myself that aligns with my best interests in life. I wish to become a storyboard artist, a profession in which I depict the scenes of an episode which will direct the animators what is happening. I am proficient in Adobe products, Clip Studio Paint and video editing. My major fields in animation are character designing and background art.</p>
<p>I started drawing when I was elementary school, and I would do it as a pastime because I watched cartoons all the time and I would imagine those cartoons with me at all times. Eventually, I started taking it seriously in middle school and even signed up for a social media account where I would post all my drawings.</p>
