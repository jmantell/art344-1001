<h2>About Me</h2>

<p> Born and raised in California, I spend most of my time at school. Other points in my life have been taken up by work as well.
    When I'm not occupied by work or school, I like to go out with friends and participate in hobbies. One of my hobbies includes music and playing drums.
    I started playing drums when I was in sixth grade, and have been playing on and off since, including playing in a band for a while. What I also find fun with drumming is learning parts of songs I like, and making new music with friends.
    Oddly enough, playing drums alone isn't as fun to me as it is to play along with other band members/ instruments. I find going to concerts, especially with friends, to be a lot of fun too.</p>

<p>As a kid, I always had an interest in extreme sports. Although I wanted to learn snowboarding, I never really got into it. The most I got into as a kid was skateboarding and bmx. 
    I had also really wanted to dirt bike because I saw my older cousins and peers doing it, and It looked like so much fun, but I never got the chance to. 
    Fortunatley, later on I saved up enough to buy my own dirt bike, and I had a friend to go with who taught me how to ride! I hope to get into snowboarding and actually learn how to do it correctly this time.
</p>
<p>I currently attend San Diego State University as a graphic design major. I hope to learn graphic and web design more in depth, along with some UI/ UX. As a junior, I hope to be able to dive deeper into learning web design, and understand more than just the basics.
    When I was younger, in elementary and middle school, I had some experience with HTML and always found it very interesting and fun to do. Once I found out that it also co-relates with graphic design, it immediately sparked my interest in web design again. </p>
