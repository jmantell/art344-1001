<h2>About Me</h2>
</div>

<div id="main-content" class="main-content">
<p>Hello, my name is Amanda and I am 26 years old. I am a senior at San Diego State University and I am majoring in Art with an emphasis in Multimedia. I hope to have a future in professional photography as well as other art mediums. I will be graduating in the Summer of 2023 and am excited to continue my artistic journey.</p>
<p>I have a horse and two dogs. My horse's name is Reed and my dogs' names are Lucy and Charlie. I have always loved animals and love getting to spend time with them. A few of Lucy's favorite things include going for walks, tennis balls, and barking at the mailman.
<p>In my free time, I enjoy riding my horse, snowboarding, swimming in the ocean, traveling, and making art.</p>
