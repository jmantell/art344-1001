        <p>Growing up in a military family, I moved around a lot from being born in Washington State, moving to Hawaii for a couple of years, and then residing in California where I'm currently living in San Diego. </p>
        <p>From going to different places, I grew fond of traveling, or simply going out and seeing whatever I could. In other words, I enjoy the experience of opening my mind and seeing new things from different perspectives of the world. Aside from my liking for travel, in my downtime I enjoy listening to music, watching movies/shows, and hanging out with friends and family. I also like to be active and do things with my hands, so I want to try the crafting of crocheting and jewelry making. </p>
        <p>I am currently a 3rd-year multimedia art major at San Diego State University. I have always been interested in art ever since I was young and thought it would be fitting for me to pursue a career in it. Though, I am still quite unsure on what I want to do in the multimedia field, but the pro of this major is that it allows me to explore different art forms, insights, and design such as motion and graphics, film, photography, animations, and so on. So with some more exploring and gaining knowledge, I hope to go into the field of art with an emphasis in multimedia. </p>
