            <p>My passion in life is drawing. I began drawing rather late in my life, nearing the end of my senior year of high school. Then in my second year of college I realized that I wanted to go into a career involing art and drawing. At this moment I am working towards a career in animation.</p>
            <p>I am an avid enjoyer of video games. I have been playing video games since I was elementary. I believe the first video game I played was Chicken Little on the GameBoy Advanced, which I still have to this day.</p>
            <p>My favorite sport is volleyball. Although for a majority of my life I had mainly played soccer, during college was when I discovered volleyball.</p>
