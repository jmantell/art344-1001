<h2>About Me</h2>

<div id="main-content" class="main-content">
    <p> I am a bilingual, third year Graphic Design student who owns a small art business called <b>Raccatsuko.</b> My favorite hobbies include livestreaming video games such as Legend of Zelda (Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask) on TikTok, working out at the gym, and drawing. I have a very short attention span and most likely have ADHD.
    <p> As I mentioned, I have a strong relationship with art and design. I've been an artist all my life, so I decided, "Why not make a living for it?" As of now, my business consists of me accepting commissions and making designs to print out stickers and then sell them. I've drawn a variety of things; from humans, animals, objects, backgrounds, and so on, and I'd like to consider myself a good artist. My Instagram page where I post my artworks and personal projects is @raccatsuko. </p>
    <p> If there's anything I love more in this world, it's cats and the Legend of Zelda series. I love Zelda so much that I make fan art of it. I previously mentioned how I livestreamed, and on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays, I livestream Zelda games on TikTok. If you wanna check that out, my Tiktok account is @raccocaine. I've gain over 3,000 followers and received a good amount of donations from my followers and viewers. </p>
