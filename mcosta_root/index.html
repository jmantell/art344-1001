<h2>About My Multimedia Journey</h2>

	<article id="main-body" class="main-body">
<p> Hello everyone, I am Matthew Costa and I am a fourth year student at SDSU. I am studying multimedia with the intent of becoming a graphic designer when I graduate. I have been dabbling in multimedia for about eight years now and love the flexibility that the field gives me. It started freshman year of high school when I decided to take a multimedia class. In that class I worked on programs like photoshop and illustrator while also still doing some fine art projects like drawing and painting. This broad approach was great for my development as an artist because I got to explore various mediums and meet other people with many different emphasis in art.</p>
	<p> I joined media communications academy my sophomore year of high school and was given a class of thirty or so people I would have multiple classes with that incorporated elements of multimedia into their curriculum. This allowed me to constantly think about design and actually consider it as a career choice for myself when I got older. We had various projects ranging from screen printing to logo design and even painting. I stayed in MCA for the three years left I had of high school and graduated with a certification in Adobe premiere CS6. I originally wanted to study film after graduation but faced a bump in the road after I didnâ€™t get into the competitive film department here at SDSU. Because of this, I went back to what I knew best and pursued multimedia again. </p>
	<p> After I graduate, I hope to pursue a career in graphic design and specifically focus on branding or coming up with logo designs from scratch for startup companies. I find the process of this to be very rewarding for myself as I try to convey the certain aspects of a company to the public. If I was not going to be a graphic designer, I would probably pursue a career in the fine arts along side content creation and try to build up a following based off of my work on social media and try to make a living that way. I think there is no better time to be an artist as we now have so many different tools and avenues at our disposal. </p>
