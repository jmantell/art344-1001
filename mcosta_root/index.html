<div id="main-content" class="main-content">
    <p>Hello everyone, my name is Matthew Costa and I'm a fourth year student at SDSU. I am studying multimedia with the intent of becoming a graphic designer when I graduate. I have beeen dabbling in multimedia for about eight years now and I love the flexibility that the field gives me. My freshman year of highschool I was introduced to my first media class and I took off from there. I have since worked in nboth digital and fine art mediums.</p>
    <p>I originally wanted to study film after highschool but did not get into the program and switched majors back into what I was most familar with.</p>
    <p>After I graduate I hope to pursue a career in graphic design and work for myself. I would also like to pursue a fine art career with deams of seeing my art in a gallery one day. Like many artists I hope to see my work in the hands of others that enjoy it.</p>
