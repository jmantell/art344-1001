<h2>About Me</h2>

<div id="main-content" class="main-content">
<p>I was born and raised in San Diego. Currently I still live with my family and work at an ice cream shop. I've moved two or three times in my life, but every time it was very close by, so I haven't seen much outside of Southern California.</p>
<p>As a child I really enjoyed making things. Most occupations I aspired to be involved art. Today, I am majoring in Graphic Design at San Diego State University.</p>
<p>Ice cream is one of my favorite foods, and I think bees are pretty neat.</p>
