<p styles="font-size:16px; line-height:24px; font-weight:bold;">I was born in Rome/Italy, moved to the states in sophmore year of highschool. I am currently an art multimedia major that transitioned from a bio major. I attended an international school in Rome and was taught engish from a young age. I also took spanish at that school and carried it forward when i moved to highschool here.</p>
<p>When I moved to the states I attended Calabasas High school in Los Angeles, i spend 3 years there where I graduated in 2018. I took many classes and was preparing as a bio major at the time.</p>
<p>After I graduated in 2018, i attended SMC for 3 years, and then eventually I moved to San diego in August of 2022 and began my degree in Multimedia arts.</p>
