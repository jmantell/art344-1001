<p style="font-size:18px; line-height: 24px; font-weight:bold;">I have my own art business. Follow me @bree.makemesomething on Instagram. I live in Pacific Beach with my roommate, Grace. I love dogs and our planet earth. I'm a Libra, my Rising Sign is Scoprio and my Moon sign is also Scorpio. I was born in Bellflower, CA then I moved to Texas when I was 4 years old. I grew up in Texas til I was 14, then moved to Palm Springs, CA for highschool.</p>

<p>I am a Communication Major with a Minor in Multi Media Art. I would like to go into a graphic design related field after graduation, but I hope the company I work for does something I am interested in as well.</p>

<p>I used to work for a company in the tech and science startup space, and although I loved my role, I wasn't interested in what the company did. This lack of interest became apparent in my work and was a big turning point in my career. I hope the company I work for next is creative or does something that is related to my hobbies or general interests.</p>
