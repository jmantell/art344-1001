<h2>About Me</h2>
</div>

<div id="main-content" class="main-content">
<p>I was born and raised in San Diego. I am a multimedia major. This is my second year here at San Diego State University after transferring from San Diego City College. I plan to graduate next semester. I was born in the year of the rabbit, so I'm excited to see how this year goes for me!</p> 
<p>My interests include Sanrio, Miffy, Studio Ghibli, Sailor Moon, Spongebob Squarepants, Shrek, and Disney. I love Spongebob so much, my first tattoo is the drawing that says loser and points at Squidward.</p>
<p> Some of the hobbies I partake in are cooking, baking, painting, and playing video games. I became interested in most of these hobbies after spending a lot of time with my family. I like to play Fall Guys, Overcooked, and GTA with my friend on some weekends. </p>
