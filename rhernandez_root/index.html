<h2>About Me</h2>
</div>

<div id="main-content" class="main-content">
<p>I was born and raised in San Diego. I am a multimedia major. This is my second year here at San Diego State University after transferring from San Diego City College. I plan to graduate next semester. I was born in the year of the rabbit, so I'm excited to see how this year goes for me!</p> 
<p>My interests include Sanrio, Miffy, Studio Ghibli, Sailor Moon, Spongebob Squarepants, Shrek, and Disney. A couple years ago, I often took trips to Disneyland with my family because we had annual passes. After the pandemic, our trips have become less frequent, however we make plans to other parks like Universal Studios Hollywood.</p>
<p> Some of the hobbies I partake in are cooking, baking, painting, and playing video games. I became interested in most of these hobbies after spending a lot of time with my family. I consider myself a shopaholic, so I often go through my closet and try to get rid of as much clothing as possible. I would normally ask my friends to see if they want any of my unwanted clothes before I put them in a bag and send to an online thrift shop to receive money for the pieces of clothes that shoppers bought that were mine.</p>
