        <p>I am a really cool guy. I am 53 years old and I have a twin brother who looks just like me but, my wife says he's ugly so I don't know what that says about me. I am sure she doesn't think I am ugly though because she says I am a good looking dude. Plus she doesn't throw up when she looks at me. We also have kids that seem to like me too. They are both girls and in high school.</p>
        <p>I am an art major and specializing in MultiMedia. I really love hand-drawn animation and have a digital hand drawn animation setup at home. I animate with TvPaint.</p>
        <p>This is my second semester at SDSU and I am a junior. I transfered from Grossmont College with an Associates degree in Studio Art. I also graduated with Phi Theta Kappa honors.I am also the first person in my family to graduate and go to college.</p>
